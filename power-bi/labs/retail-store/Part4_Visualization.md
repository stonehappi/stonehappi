**How:**
1. Add **Line Chart**.
2. Axis: `DateTable[Date]`
3. Values: `EstimatedDays`, `ActualDays`
4. Title: **"Lead Time Accuracy Over Time"**

**Why:**  
Helps analyze logistics performance and supplier dependability.

4. Legend: `ItemName`
5. Title: **"Daily Consumption Trend"**

**Why:**

   - `Stock Status` (from DAX)

**Why:**  
Slicers let users control views without changing the actual report design.
