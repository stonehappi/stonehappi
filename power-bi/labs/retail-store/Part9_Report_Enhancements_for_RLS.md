# üìà Part 9: Report Enhancements for Row-Level Security (RLS)

---

### üéØ Objective:
To align your Power BI report design with your RLS model so users only see what they‚Äôre authorized to see, while ensuring the report remains informative and user-friendly.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Add a ‚ÄúCurrent User‚Äù Card

**How:**
1. Create a measure:
```DAX
CurrentUser = USERNAME()
```
2. Add a **Card** visual and use this measure.

**Why:**  
Confirms that RLS is being applied and identifies the currently logged-in user.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Display the User‚Äôs Role (Optional)

**How:**
1. Create a measure:
```DAX
UserRole = 
CALCULATE(
  VALUES(UserAccess[Role]),
  UserAccess[Username] = USERNAME()
)
```
2. Show this value using a **Card** or **Table** visual.

**Why:**  
Lets the user (and you during testing) know which role they're assigned.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Review Visual Filters

**Action:**
- Ensure all visuals use `ItemCode` (or relevant) filtering from the RLS model.
- Use **View as Role** to test role-level results.

**Why:**  
Protects against unauthorized data exposure and ensures accurate filtering across the report.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Avoid Global Totals (or Make Them Manager-Only)

**Issue:**  
Totals like ‚ÄúAll Sales‚Äù or ‚ÄúAll Stock‚Äù can mislead users who only see partial data.

**Solutions:**
- Use RLS-safe measures:
```DAX
Total Sales (Secure) = 
CALCULATE([Total Sales], KEEPFILTERS(UserAccess[ItemCode]))
```
- OR create a **Manager-only page** with global metrics.

**Why:**  
Avoids misleading numbers and upholds RLS intent.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Create Role-Based Report Pages (Optional)

**Action:**
- Duplicate main pages.
- Tailor views per role:
  - SalesRep ‚Üí Sales by Item
  - StockClerk ‚Üí Inventory trends
  - Procurement ‚Üí Purchases + Lead Times

**Why:**  
Improves navigation and reduces clutter for each user type.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Add a README or Info Tab

**Content to include:**
- Role definitions
- What each user can see
- Who to contact for access

**Why:**  
Enhances documentation and helps new users understand access limitations.
