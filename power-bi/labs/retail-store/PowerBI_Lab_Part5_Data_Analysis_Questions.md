## ✅ Step 1: Identify the Best-Selling Items

**What to do:**
- Use the **Bar Chart** (Inventory vs. `Total Sales`).
- Sort by descending order.
- Use a filter to select a specific year or month.

**Question:**  
🔍 *Which 5 items generated the highest total sales in 2023?*

**Why:**  
This helps managers decide which products to promote, prioritize for stock, or analyze for seasonal trends.

## ✅ Step 2: Detect Understocked or Overstocked Items

**What to do:**
- Use the **Inventory bar chart** or the **Stock Status (Low/OK)** filter.
- Review items marked as "Low".

**Question:**  
🔍 *Which items are at risk of stockouts and need restocking immediately?*  
🔍 *Are there items with too much stock but low sales?*

**Why:**  
Stockouts lead to lost sales. Overstock leads to wasted space and tied-up capital. Balancing this is crucial.

🔍 *Which items have excessive purchase volumes compared to their sales?*

**Why:**  
Efficient inventory relies on aligning purchases with expected demand.

🔍 *Are there any sudden spikes or drops in consumption patterns?*

**Why:**  
Understanding consumption helps with replenishment cycles and demand forecasting.

## ✅ Step 6: Measure Business Growth Over Time

**What to do:**

**Question:**  
🔍 *Is the business growing year over year?*
