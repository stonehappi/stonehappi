# 📤 Part 6: Publishing and Sharing Your Power BI Report  
### *(Step-by-Step with Reasoning)*

---

### 🎯 Objective:
To publish your Power BI dashboard to the cloud so it can be accessed from any device, shared with others, and updated automatically.

## ✅ Step 1: Save Your Report as a PBIX File

**How:**
1. Click **File** on the top left of Power BI Desktop.
2. Select **Save As**.
3. Name it: `Final_Sales_Inventory_Report.pbix`
4. Save it to your local drive.

**Why:**  
The `.pbix` file is the Power BI project file. Saving it allows you to reopen and edit later. It’s also required before uploading.

## ✅ Step 2: Sign in to Power BI Service

**How:**
1. Open your browser.
2. Go to [https://app.powerbi.com](https://app.powerbi.com)
3. Click **Sign in**.
4. Enter your **school or Microsoft 365 organization account** (e.g., `you@university.edu`).

**Why:**  
Power BI Service is the online platform where you manage and publish dashboards. Without signing in, you can’t publish or share anything.

## ✅ Step 3: Publish Report from Power BI Desktop

**How:**
1. Return to Power BI Desktop.
2. Click the **Publish** button on the **Home tab**.
3. Select your workspace:
   - Choose **“My Workspace”** if you're publishing for yourself.
   - Choose a team workspace if you are collaborating.
4. Wait for upload confirmation.

**Why:**  
This step sends your report to the cloud. From there, you can view, share, and update it.

## ✅ Step 4: Open Your Report in the Cloud

**How:**
1. Go to [https://app.powerbi.com](https://app.powerbi.com)
2. Click **My Workspace**.
3. Find your report under the **Reports** tab.
4. Click it to open.

**Why:**  
Use this to check that your report is working correctly in the browser. Sometimes slicers or visuals may look different from Desktop.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Share the Report with Others

**How:**
1. With the report open, click **Share** (top-right corner).
2. Enter the email addresses of people you want to share with (e.g., your instructor or teammates).
3. Choose:
   - **Allow recipients to share** (if collaboration is needed)
   - **Allow build permission** (if they need to create visuals from your dataset)
4. Add a message (optional), then click **Send**.

**Why:**  
This lets your team or instructor view and interact with your dashboard from their browser — no Desktop needed.

## ✅ Step 6: Schedule Automatic Data Refresh (Optional, Advanced)

**How:**
1. In Power BI Service, click on the **Datasets + Dataflows** tab.
2. Find your dataset (same name as your report).
3. Click **Settings > Schedule Refresh**.
4. Enable refresh.
5. Set the time (e.g., daily at 6 AM).
6. Set credentials (only needed if pulling from protected Excel, SQL, or SharePoint sources).

**Why:**  
If your data changes often, refresh ensures your dashboard is always current without needing to republish.

## ✅ Step 7: Export or Embed the Report

**Export to PDF:**
1. Open the report in Power BI Service.
2. Click **File > Export > PDF**

**Embed in Website or LMS:**
1. Click **File > Embed Report > Website or Portal**.
2. Copy the HTML or link to share in Google Classroom, Moodle, or an email.

**Why:**  
This makes your report flexible for use in presentations, LMS platforms, or documentation.
